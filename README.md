# Socket-Connection-With-Graph
Access the Socket Url to fetch continuous data and show over Graph

Two formats of files are uploaded- One with the Zip file and other one as source code. If Source code have missed any file then work with the Zip file.

run pod install to work properly as the code requires the Swifty-Charts pods updation too.

Using SocketIO the connection is established to server that is genereating random number after every 4 Seconds

Note: - Confirm the url is Active or Not; to check this run the URL in Browser (Check Constant.Swift file for URL)

Using SwiftCharts the Spline Chart is displayed ; that will refresh as sooner the Socket got number between 1-9

Reachability is used to check for drop connection; The notifier always works and show the error message

A Simple and easy integration of core data is shown here to store and fetch values using Core Data

This Example also contains a Local Notification Demo which will popup with Custom Sound file when the socket will receive consecutive Same number.

Feel free to reach me if any Error or Doubt is there

Happy Ending; Cheers!!!!
